# Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures and examples for the paper "Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow" by Paolo Guasoni and Nazem Khan (2024). 

## Figures

Start by reading [General Method](GeneralMethod.ipynb). This notebook describes our approach for computing the optimal channel deposits and determining the optimal policy for a general transaction stream with continuously distributed payments. It is a prerequisite for running and understanding the code in the notebooks located in the [figures](figures) directory.  Each notebook in this directory provides the code for generating the corresponding figure in our paper.

## Examples

The notebooks in this directory adapt the [General Method](GeneralMethod.ipynb). Each one provides the code for generating the corresponding example in our paper.
