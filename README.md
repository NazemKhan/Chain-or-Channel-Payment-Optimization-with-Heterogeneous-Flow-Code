# Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures and examples for our paper "Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow" by Paolo Guasoni and Nazem Khan (2024). 

## Figures

Start by reading [General Method](GeneralMethod.ipynb). This notebook describes our approach for computing the optimal channel deposits and determining the optimal policy for a general transaction stream with continuous payments. Moreover, the code in this file is a prerequisite for running the code in the files located in the [figures](figures) directory.  Each file in this directory provides the code for generating the corresponding figures in our paper.
