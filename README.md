# Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures and examples for the paper "Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow" by Paolo Guasoni and Nazem Khan (2024). 

To run the code, you need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

And to fully understand the code, you should be familiar with the notation and jargon in our paper.

Start by reading the file GeneralMethod.ipynb as this describes the method for computing the optimal channel deposits and the optimal policy for a general transaction stream $(\tau_k,\Delta_k)_{k \geq 1}$. This will make it easier to follow the rest of the code.


Actually use Jupyter notebook to write about general procedure. Then files for figs 1-3, figs 4-6 and figs 7-10. In particular, for the more complicated ones just draw table of results (refer to desmos) and then give the code for the pictures.
