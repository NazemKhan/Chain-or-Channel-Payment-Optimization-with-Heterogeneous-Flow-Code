# Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures and examples for the paper "Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow" by Paolo Guasoni and Nazem Khan (2024). 

## Figures

Each notebook in this directory provides the code for generating the corresponding figure in our paper.

Start by reading [General Method](GeneralMethod.ipynb). This notebook describes our approach for computing the optimal channel deposits and determining the optimal policy for a general transaction stream with continuously distributed payments. Excluding [Figure 2](figure2.ipynb), it is the only prerequisite for running and understanding the code in the notebooks located in the [figures](figures) directory. As for [Figure 2](figure2.ipynb), one must also read [General Method](EvolutionOfChannelBalance.ipynb)

## Examples

The notebooks in the [examples](examples) directory adapt the [General Method](GeneralMethod.ipynb). Each one provides the code for generating the corresponding example in our paper.
