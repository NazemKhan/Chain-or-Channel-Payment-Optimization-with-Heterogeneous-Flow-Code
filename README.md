# Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures and examples for the paper "Chain or Channel? Payment Optimization with Heterogeneous Flow" by Paolo Guasoni and Nazem Khan (2024). 

## Figures

Start by reading [General Method](GeneralMethod.ipynb). This describes our method for computing the optimal channel deposits and the optimal policy for a general transaction stream with continuous payments. Moreover, the functions in that file are used throughout the files in [figures](figures).
